## Design and User Guide

A description and user guide disguised as a blog post can be found [here](http://lbradstreet.github.io/clojure/onyx/distributed-systems/2015/02/18/onyx-dashboard.html).

## Versioning

Version numbers will kept in sync with [Onyx]
(https://github.com/onyx-platform/onyx). For example, to use a version
compatible with Onyx 0.6.0, use a version fo the dashboard beginning with
0.6.0. The fourth version number will be reserved for dashboard versioning, in
order to provide releases out of band with Onyx.

## Development

Setup an environment variable for `ZOOKEEPER_ADDR` in your lein user profiles.clj like so:

```clojure
{:user {:env {:zookeeper-addr "54.44.229.123:2181,54.44.240.52:2181"}}}
```

or by setting the environment variable in your shell.

Then open a terminal and run `lein figwheel` to start the Figwheel build
(https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel).

and run `lein repl` to start your repl.

In the REPL, run

```clojure
(user/go)
```

Then point your browser at http://localhost:3000/

## Deployment

Configure an environment variable `ZOOKEEPER_ADDR`.

e.g. `ZOOKEEPER_ADDR="54.44.229.123:2181,54.44.240.52:2181"` 

Then run the Onyx Dashboard in one of several ways:

* Download the [uberjar
version](https://github.com/lbradstreet/onyx-dashboard/releases).
  Then run it via `java -jar FILENAME`.
* Or build and run the uberjar `lein clean && lein with-profile uberjar uberjar`. 
Then run it via `java -jar target/onyx-dashboard.jar`.
* Or use the development instructions above.
