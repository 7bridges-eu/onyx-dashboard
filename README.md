A dashboard for the Onyx distributed computation system
(https://github.com/MichaelDrogalis/onyx). 

## Development

Setup environment variables for `HORNETQ_PORT`, `HORNETQ_HOST`, and `ZOOKEEPER_ADDR` in your lein user profiles.clj like so:

```
{:user {:env {:hornetq-port 5445
	      :hornetq-host "54.44.41.99"
	      :zookeeper-addr "54.44.229.123:2181,54.44.240.52:2181"}
```

or by setting the environment variables in your shell.

Then open a terminal and type `lein figwheel` to start the Figwheel build
(https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel).

and run `lein repl` to start your repl.

In the REPL, type

```clojure
(user/go)
```

Then point your browser at http://localhost:3000/
